This program is a simple game that can be tested if you can count as accurately as a stopwatch.
You can set up the time in the right text box.
1. Pressing the start button to start the timer.
2. Stoping the timer when the time is same as you set up.
3. The application can tell you whether you are correct.
4. We can hide or show the actual time if you never win in this game that can help you get a easy way to win.
5. I will update this game in the future to make it more playability.
